The program "mixture" is dependent on the following libraries:
numpy 
sklearn
matplotlib
Progress.

The .py file "patch" is a monkey patch found in the progress 
documentation published by user An0ndev.
It simply cleans up an extra char printed in the progress bar.

The mixture program houses the entirity of the 
simulartion, error checking and graphical code. 

This should all run properly on your machine assuming the mixture 
is run in a directory containing "patch.py".
